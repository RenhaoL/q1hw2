# q1hw2

This is the second homework. The goal is to get familiar with Seaborn. 
Three graphs (scatter plot, histogram, linear regression) are generated based on the data from mytestfile.fastq file. 
Moreover, different functions were called to generate the graphs, but only the code for generating the three graphs are kept, and the rest were commented out. 

Screenshots were included in the repository. 

The seaborn version is 0.9.0
